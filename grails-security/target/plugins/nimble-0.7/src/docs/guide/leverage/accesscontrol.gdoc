One of the core functionality that nimble brings to any host application is support for authorization.
Nimble utilizes Apache Shiro for access control process.

Access control in host applications is verified in one of two ways:
# By the host application making a direct call to subject.isPermitted(), subject.hasAllRoles() or subject.hasRole()
# By a grails filter invoking accessControl closure.
