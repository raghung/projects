Nimble adds two dynamic methods @getAuthenticatedUser@ and @getAuthenticatedSubject@ to all Filter,controller and Service artefacts.

*getAuthenticatedUser* Returns currently logged in user or null if user is not logged in.

{code}

def sampleAction() {
	log.debug("current user : $authenticatedUser")
}
 
{code}

*getAuthenticatedSubject* Returns current subject, or null if user is not logged in. It is same as calling SecurityUtils.getSubject()
