Nimble has password requirements for new user registration. Default is as shown below:

{code:groovy}
nimble{
  passwords {
    mustcontain {
      lowercase = true
      uppercase = true
      numbers = true
      symbols = true
    }
    minlength = 8
  }
}
{code}

It can be overridden in @NimbleConfig.groovy@
